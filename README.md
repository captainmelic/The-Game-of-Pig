pigsim.py runs a number n of simulations based on k, a number which the player should hold at after reaching or surpassing.

playpig.py lets you play a game of pig (singleplayer, win in as few rounds as possible!).

ultrapigsim.py runs an n number of simulations for each integer k in a given range.

pigsimprob.py is just like pigsim.py, but it returns the probability of winning in a given number of turns while holding at a given value k.

versuspig.py allows you to play against the "hold at 20" strategy
